In this ML project, we delve into analyzing the number of visitors on a website across different engagement levels. These engagement levels, denoted by 'Lv1_Visitors' to 'Lv5_Visitors', serve as indicators of varying degrees of visitor interaction and involvement with the website.

Starting with 'Lv1_Visitors', this level represents the least engaged or casual visitors who may browse the website, view products, or spend minimal time without taking significant actions. 'Lv2_Visitors' denote users who display slightly higher engagement, actively interacting with the website, exploring sections, and potentially adding products to their cart.

Moving up the ladder, 'Lv3_Visitors' represent visitors demonstrating a moderate level of engagement. They spend more time on the site, browse through multiple product categories, add items to their cart, and may initiate the checkout process. 'Lv4_Visitors' indicate users with a high level of engagement, as they not only add items to their cart and proceed to checkout but also complete the purchase, signifying converted buyers.

Interestingly, 'Lv5_Visitors' also represents visitors with a high level of engagement, mirroring the behavior of 'Lv4_Visitors'. This level is mentioned twice in the given description but appears to have been duplicated. It's safe to assume that both 'Lv4_Visitors' and 'Lv5_Visitors' reflect the same engagement level of converted buyers.

Throughout the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, several insights were uncovered. The analysis highlighted the states that witnessed the highest number of visits, shedding light on regions with significant user engagement. Additionally, the analysis identified the engagement level with the most visitors, providing valuable information on the predominant user behavior on the website.

Moreover, the project investigated how visitor numbers fluctuate over time, allowing for the observation of trends and patterns. Year-on-year growth was computed, providing an understanding of the website's performance and potential areas for improvement.

Transitioning to the modeling phase, the project employed the ARIMA algorithm for forecasting the number of visitors for the next year and beyond. ARIMA, an acronym for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, is a widely used algorithm for time series forecasting. By leveraging historical data and considering various factors, ARIMA models can generate reliable predictions for future visitor numbers.

In conclusion, this ML project conducted a comprehensive analysis of website visitor engagement levels, examined key insights such as state-wise visits and engagement level distribution, and explored visitor variations over time. By employing ARIMA for forecasting, the project offers the ability to predict visitor numbers for future periods, aiding in decision-making, resource allocation, and optimization strategies for the website's performance.
